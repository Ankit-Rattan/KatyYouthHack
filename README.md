## Inspiration
The news of textile waste and its sustainability.  

## What it does
**Side-Garbage** provides a platform that connects the ordinary people to organizations that work for the **sustainability of textiles**.

## How we built it
Built with HTML, CSS, and build the  Graphic images using CANVA.

## Challenges we ran into
The alignment and smoothness.
The idea that is so underrated is hard to convey through the webpage and its presentation. Still, I tried my best to do it from my hand. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The concept of the sustainability of textiles is a topic that is hardly discussed. However, it is one of the crucial topics that the world is suffering from. The click of making a project on this topic itself makes me proud.

## What we learned
I understood that there are many issues like this one and need to implement the solution for the same.

## What's next for Side-Garbage
If got the required feed back. Our vision is to implement this in practical life and make others aware about this crucial issue.
